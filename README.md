# Bounding Volume Hierarchy Balancing Test

This is a little test project I made to empirically prove a hunch I had about the effect of balancing a BVH structure implemented with a binary tree would lead to less efficient programs due to larger and less efficient bounding volumes splitting the scene.

To run project, ensure a venv has been created and `requirements.txt` has been used to install dependecies and then run `RayTracer.py`
